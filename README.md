This specialization focuses on - 

1. Preparing data, detecting statistical biases, performing feature engineering at scale to train models, evaluate and fine tune models with AutoML.
2. Building, deploying, monitoring and operationalize end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
3. Storing and managing ML features using feature store. Debugging, profiling, tuning, & evaluating models while tracking data lineage and model artifacts.
4. Building data labeling and human-in-the-loop pipelines to improve model performance with human intelligence.
